# libraryManagementSystem

This system is dedicated to library management and efficient book-keeping. The "Library Management System" project encompasses a comprehensive database of information about the books available in the library, facilitating seamless lending to customers, and streamlined record-keeping by the staff. In addition to managing the system's overall functionality, we meticulously maintain records of issue statuses and the publishers associated with each book. This system aims to enhance the library experience for both librarians and patrons by providing a robust and organized platform for book management.

## MISSION OBJECTIVE

Revolutionize the college library experience with an efficient and user-friendly SQL-based Library Management System. Our objective is to optimize book management, empower librarians with powerful SQL tools, enhance the patron experience, ensure data accuracy through SQL databases, integrate modern SQL technology, and encourage collaborative SQL development for continuous improvement.
